jsPlumb_Liviz.js
================

A combination of the [jsPlumb](https://github.com/sporritt/jsplumb) library that connects elements with the [Liviz.js](https://github.com/gyuque/livizjs) for the positioning of these elements.

In other words: using jsPlumb for the UI (connecting divs), and Liviz.js for the positioning of these elements (divs).

All changes were done to the Liviz.js code, and are:
- Removal of code that writes to the canvas (since I'm using jsPlumb's UI/connectors).
- After getting the new positions of the elements, updating the elements with these positions, and redrawing the connectors (since the connectors are not updated after the divs are computationally moved).
- The "em-dotgen.js" is pretty big, so it was minified.

This combination was worked on for the [LNDB.info](http://lndb.info/) site as a "character relation diagram" feature.

Update:

I have re-compiled GraphViz's code for the fdp, sfdp, neato, twopi, and circo layout engines. The source code has been added under the src folder. Follow the same steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/gyuque/livizjs) to compile the code...

There are currently six available layout engines:
- [dot](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dot.1.pdf) (via the em-dotgen.min.js javascript file)
- [fdp](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/fdp.1.pdf) (via the em-fdpgen.min.js javascript file)
- [sfdp](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/sfdp.1.pdf) (via the em-sfdpgen.min.js javascript file)
- [neato](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/neato.1.pdf) (via the em-neatogen.min.js javascript file)
- [twopi](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/twopi.1.pdf) (via the em-twopigen.min.js javascript file)
- [circo](http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/circo.1.pdf) (via the em-circogen.min.js javascript file)

The example here uses the dot layout engine, but to use other layout engines (fdp, sfdp, neato, twopi, or circo) follow these steps:
- In the jsPlumbChar.htm file, change the content of the div with the id "layout-engine" from dot to the desired layout engine (fdp, sfdp, neato, twopi, or circo).
- In the main.js file, change the value of the LAYOUT_ENGINE variable from dot to the same layout engine you picked in the above step.

## jsPlumb
jsPlumb provides a means for a developer to visually connect elements on their web pages. It uses SVG or 
Canvas in modern browsers, and VML on IE 8 and below.

## Liviz.js
An interactive Graphviz in javascript.
